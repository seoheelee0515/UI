    <h3>8 Sustainably Designed Green Buildings in Singapore</h3>
    <article>
      <p>
        Are you wondering about the different green buildings in Singapore?
        Interior Design has the inside scoop on 8 sustainably designed
        commercial spaces across the country. It has been only 54 years since
        Singapore declared independence, but the island nation has grown to be
        one of the most powerful yet environmentally responsible economies in
        the world. Walking through Singapore’s vibrant downtown, that meteoric
        rise in sustainable architecture—much of it constructed over the past
        decade—is reflected in a cool mix of glass, steel, and lush green
        edifices that create a rich panorama of structural design.

      <p>
        While architectural marvels in their own right, what sets Singapore’s
        urban buildings apart is the commitment to green initiatives. “Singapore
        is the only country that makes it mandatory by legislation for any
        building of about 5,000 square meters [53,820 square feet] to achieve
        minimum standards as per the code for environmental sustainability,”
        says Mayank Kaushal, an architect, senior sustainability consultant, and
        researcher with Future Cities Laboratory, a program supported by ETH
        Zurich and Singapore’s National Research Foundation to help promote
        sustainable future cities through research, science, and design.
      </p>

      <p>
        While builders are incentivized every step of the way to adhere to
        sustainable design practices, the most remarkable incentive is the
        Skyrise Greenery Incentives 2.0 scheme established in 2009 by the
        country’s National Parks Board, which funds up to 50 percent of
        installation costs of rooftops and vertical greenery—more than 110
        projects to date. The result has been stunning builds ranging in scale,
        scope, and purpose yet with a common theme of using natural elements
        cleverly to reduce the impact of urban living.

    <h3>
      SINGAPORE GREEN BUILDINGS: ARCHITECTURALLY SIGNIFICANT AT THE FORE OF
      SUSTAINABLE DESIGN
    </h3>
    <h4>Oasia Hotel Downtown by WOHA</h4>
    <article>
      <p>
        Not only is the entire 27-floor external facade wrapped in a natural
        vine covered sunscreen, but the Oasia Hotel Downtown also has four lush
        sky terraces, 1,793 large planter boxes, and four large structural cores
        that allow for good cross ventilation reducing the overall energy cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designed by WOHA and completed in 2016, the hotel is home to over 33
        species of plants and 21 species of creepers. In addition, the 314-room
        property is notable for its striking interior design by Patricia
        Urquiola.

    <h4>Gardens by the Bay by Wilkinson Eyre</h4>
    <article>
      <p>
        One of the biggest attractions in Singapore since its opening in October
        2011, Gardens by the Bay has garnered accolades for both its
        sustainability and its ambitious design by Wilkinson Eyre.
      </p>

      <p>
        Part horticultural attraction and part showcase for green technology,
        the 250-acre gardens feature two conservatories (the largest
        climate-controlled greenhouses in the world) and a forest of 18
        Supertrees, which range from 82 to 164 feet tall. The Supertrees have
        incorporated technologies such as PVs, which are cooling channels in
        their structure to moderate the surrounding environment, and a skin of
        living flora that uses the tree structure as a trellis and contains more
        than 1.5 million plants.
