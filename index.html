            <h2>NYC Museums</h2>
            <p>New York City’s cultural amenities are many, but none quite match the number, scale, and variety of its museums. There is literally an institution for every interest, whether it’s in art, history, science, or quirkier subjects. From 5,000 years of art history at The Metropolitan Museum to cutting-edge art at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York City is an art lovers' paradise. There are dozens of other types of museums, too, like the encyclopedic American Museum Of Natural History, the classical New-York Historical Society, and the sultry Museum of Sex. Photography fans have to check out the International Center of Photography, architecture buffs should head to the Skyscraper Museum, and transit lovers can't miss the New York Transit Museum. And, of course, that’s just the tip of the iceberg, even if you don’t count all of the other museums in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx.</p>

            <h3>Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</h3>

            <p>
                While the Guggenheim’s collection of modern art works is certainly impressive, it is impossible to
                separate the museum’s contents from its form with architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s brilliant and
                controversial design. Opened in 1959 on Fifth Ave across from Central Park, just months after
                Wright’s death, the concrete inverted ziggernaut (a Babylonian step pyramid), stomped on the
                expectations and tradition of clean square galleries exemplified and cherished by the neighboring
                Upper East Side museums, like the nearby Metropolitan Museum. Instead Wright combined his use
                of geometric shapes and nature, to create a gallery space that presented art along a flowing,
                winding spiral, much like a nautilus shell, with little in the way of walls to separate artists, ideas, or
                time periods. Best experienced as Wright intended by taking the elevator to the top of the museum
                and following the gentle slope down, the art is revealed at different angles along the descent and
                across the open circular rotunda in a way that even the most well-known Monet landscape might
                seem like a revelation.

            <h3>Whitney Museum of American Art</h3>

            <p>
                Find the Whitney Museum in the Meatpacking District inside a building designed by international starchitect Renzo Piano. Planted at the foot of the Highline along Gansevoort Street, the Whitney building boasts some 63,000 square feet of both indoor and outdoor exhibition space. Part horticultural attraction and part showcase for green technology, the 250-acre gardens feature two conservatories (the largest climate-controlled greenhouses in the world) and a forest of 18 Supertrees, which range from 82 to 164 feet tall. The Supertrees have incorporated technologies such as PVs, which are cooling channels in their structure to moderate the surrounding environment, and a skin of living flora that uses the tree structure as a trellis and contains more than 1.5 million plants.

            <h3>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</h3>

            <p>
                It would take multiple visits to fully appreciate this sprawling (as in 13 acres of Central Park) sprawling collection of over 5,000 years of art from every corner of the world. As one of the biggest museums in the world, the gorgeous late 19th-century neo-classical institution displays some of the finest examples of art spanning from mummified royalty of ancient times to avant-garde fashion couture from last year’s runway. Visitors young and old are mesmerized by the Temple of Dendur, an Egyptian temple from 10 B.C. that was transposed from its Nile-side location to the bright, sun-drenched space overlooking a reflective pool. Other highlights include the impressive array of European and Asian armor, Grecian sculptures, medieval art, and contemporary photography. After hours of exploring, relax by a fountain in the indoor sculpture garden or ponder what it all means in the Astor Chinese Garden Court, nestled off the Asian Art galleries.
